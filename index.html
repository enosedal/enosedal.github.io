    <h2>Biography</h2>
    <p>
      I am currently part of the UNAM’s Genomic Sciences undergraduate program, working closely with the laboratory heads at the LIIGH. I am proficient in Python, C++ as well as Java. I’m very passionate about traveling and enveloping myself in new cultures, as well as cooking, waterpolo, basketball and nutrition science. I am especially involved with community development projects through a cofounded Effective Altruism group located in Juriquilla Querétaro.
